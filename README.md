Problem Statement -
The project aims to develop a recommendation system that efficiently matches carriers (transportation service providers) with shippers (clients needing transportation) using multilabel classification techniques.
The goal is to enhance the logistics process by ensuring optimal pairing, leading to better resource utilization and customer satisfaction.

ABSTRACT -
This project explores an innovative approach to enhance logistics efficiency. Leveraging 
Support Vector Machines (SVM),Random Forest, and Decision Trees as base models, with XGBoost as the meta-model, the study aims to develop a powerful recommendation system for optimal carrier selections in shipments. The project begins with the collection
and preprocessing of historical shipment data, encompassing key variables such as weight, distance, and delivery time.

By employing a hybrid model, the project seeks to capitalize on the strengths of individual models, utilizing SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Trees to discern diverse patterns within the data. The meta-model, XGBoost, is then employed to consolidate and
refine these outputs, boosting predictive accuracy and generalizability. Anticipated outcomes include a more robust and accurate recommendation system, poised to significantly impact logistics operations by optimizing carrier selections. This project
addresses the contemporary need for streamlined supply chain management, offering a potential avenue for cost savings and heightened customer satisfaction through improved
decision-making in carrier shipments.
